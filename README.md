# elapid

Species distribution modeling tools in python. This includes a custom [MaxEnt][home-maxent] implementation, spatial processing tools, as well as tools for working with [GBIF-][home-gbif] datasets.

The name was chosen as homage to the paper by H.A. Nix, *A Biogeographic Analysis of Australian Elapid Snakes* (1986), which is widely credited with defining the essential bioclimatic variables to use in species distribution modeling. It's also a snake pun (a python wrapper for mapping snake biogeography).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```
